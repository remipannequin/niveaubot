 NiveauBot is a Discord bot to get river levels. Two mode of interaction can be used : answer to query about rivers, or alerting when the level is in a given range.
 
 Data comes form the vigicrue public service and is therefore currently limited to France only.
 
 It is currently at the very first stage of development.
